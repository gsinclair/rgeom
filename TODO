* Allow circles to have labels like :C1, not just :C

* ArgumentProcessor to enforce things like "can't specify both diameter and
  radius", in order to catch errors earlier and simplify construction code.

* Consider whether arcs should be allowed to have labels.
  They do at the moment, just like circles.  But it seems
  unnecessary.

* Consider refactoring such that Circle < Arc.  A circle
  really is a special case of an arc, where the angles are
  0 and 360 degrees!

* shape DSL, like
    shape :triangle,
            :label_size => 3,
            :arguments => {
              :base        => 'Num,Seg',  # Seg can be a real segment or :AC
              :height      => 'Num',
              :angles      => '[N]',
              :sides       => '[N]',
              :type        => [:scalene, :equilateral, :isosceles],
              :right_angle => 'Sym',
              :angle       => 'alias :angles',
              :side        => 'alias :sides'
            }
  This DSL can generate the class, complete with self.label_size and
  self.category, do the parsing and type verification, and insert the require or
  autoload statement.  Shape.create then becomes:
    def Shape.create(*args)
      spec = self.parse(*args)
      self.verify_spec(spec, *args)
      self::Constructor.construct(spec)
    end

* Specification object should contain a copy of the argument list to aid error
  reporting.  That means it can create its own ArgumentProcessor and therefore
  avoid the repetitive code s.extract(a, :side) -- i.e. the 'a' is not
  necessary.

* List of relatively minor items in commit f94afdb6
