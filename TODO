* Allow circles to have labels like :C1, not just :C
* ArgumentProcessor to enforce things like "can't specify both diameter and
  radius", in order to catch errors earlier and simplify construction code.
* Consider whether arcs should be allowed to have labels.
  They do at the moment, just like circles.  But it seems
  unnecessary.
* Consider refactoring such that Circle < Arc.  A circle
  really is a special case of an arc, where the angles are
  0 and 360 degrees!
* More thorough testing of Arc (test/arc2.rb).  It's working
  pretty well and the existing testing is good, but a lot more
  cases need to be tested.
* Prevent unwanted shapes from getting into the registry.  At
  the moment, every shape goes in there.  If you don't want
  it there, you call Register#remove.  That is awkward and
  backwards.
