22 Nov 2009:
  Implemented opt-in shape registration instead of opt-out.
  Calling circle(...) used to mean that circle was added to the
  register, and therefore rendered.  But arcs need to create a circle
  _without_ adding it to the register.  A messy "deregistration"
  approach was implemented before, with a view to changing it.
  Now:
    square(...)   # square goes in register
    _square(...)  # square doesn't go in register
  As part of this work [up to 0cbcac20], construction code was
  rationalised, such that commands.rb reads much better than it used
  to, and some cruft has been removed from the various shape classes.


21 Nov 2009:
  Completed arcs and semicircles.
  See Examples 2.04 Pythagoras's Theorem again
           and 2.05 Radioactive sign
  More work to do in future, perhaps (like Arc#radii), and a
  refactoring such that Circle < Arc, but this is a good start.
  [arc branch deleted]


17 Nov 2009:
  Starting work on arcs and semicircles. [arc branch]
    arc(:centre => p(5,2), :radius => 4, :angle => [35,91])
    semicircle(:diameter => :AB)
    arc(:radius => :AB, :angle => [10,15])
  

16 Nov 2009:
  Completed square(), including square(:base => :XY) [57261b6a] and
  square(:ABCD) [c3b31fc4b].
