22 Nov 2009:
  Starting work on enabling shapes to opt out of being registered.
  This is important so that shapes can be created to assist in the
  construction of other shapes but without being displayed themselves.
  The current arrangement -- create the shape then deregister it -- is
  a hack.  Look for syntax like
    _square(:ABCD, ...)
    Square.new(:[no]reg, ...)
  [register branch]


21 Nov 2009:
  Completed arcs and semicircles.
  See Examples 2.04 Pythagoras's Theorem again
           and 2.05 Radioactive sign
  More work to do in future, perhaps (like Arc#radii), and a
  refactoring such that Circle < Arc, but this is a good start.
  [arc branch deleted]


17 Nov 2009:
  Starting work on arcs and semicircles. [arc branch]
    arc(:centre => p(5,2), :radius => 4, :angle => [35,91])
    semicircle(:diameter => :AB)
    arc(:radius => :AB, :angle => [10,15])
  

16 Nov 2009:
  Completed square(), including square(:base => :XY) [57261b6a] and
  square(:ABCD) [c3b31fc4b].
