h: Medians of a triangle

When demonstrating the properties of a triangle, it's sufficient to use the
default scalene triangle construction.  (It's a 5-6-7 triangle.)

Here we construct segments from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite
side.  We do this explicitly, although there are (or should be) Triangle methods
to do this for us.
