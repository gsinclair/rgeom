* SEGMENT AND ANGLE MARKS

To construct triangles, squares, etc. I've used the excellent idea of creating
a _unit_ isosceles triangle (for instance) then scaling it to the required
position, size and angle.

I just realised that that approach will almost certainly work for segment marks
and angle marks as well!  Say you want to put a single segment marker on the
segment AB.  Well, pretend AB runs from the (0,0) to (1,0), put in segment marks
of the appropriate height and distance apart, and then scale them to the real
AB.

Angle marks should work the same.  Some preliminary work on transforming arcs
would be worthwhile.

Alternatively, if the length of AB is 'd', then start with the imaginary segment
(0,0) to (d,0) and place marks of a standard height and lateral separation, and
scale _that_.  It doesn't need to be of unit length; just nice and flat.
