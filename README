NAME

  RGeom: Ruby-driven geometrically-aware mathematical diagram tool


DESCRIPTION

  RGeom is a programming language (really a Ruby DSL) for generating
  mathematical diagrams.  It's inspired mainly by Eukleides and Asymptote,
  and also TikZ.

  Eukleides is not powerful enough (need to specify every point, no looping
  constructs) and the others are too low-level for my liking.  They produce
  beautiful vector diagrams in LaTeX documents with a certain degree of
  effort, but I want to produce images for use in Microsoft Word, easily.


AUDIENCE

  Anyone interested in generating mathematical diagrams easily.  However, see
  'Status' below.

  Ruby is the implementation language.  Users of this software would benefit
  from a little familiarity with Ruby.  The aim is to make the package so
  compelling that people would consider it worthwhile learning a little Ruby
  in order to use it.  That said, this project is designed to scratch my own
  itch.  If nobody else shares that itch, so be it.

  Potential users are encouraged to become familiar with the other software
  packages mentioned above.  They are mature and may meet your needs
  better.


EXAMPLES

  This code would produce a right-angled triangle with a square on each side,
  suitable for demonstrating the Pythagorean Theorem.

    require 'rgeom'

    triangle :ABC, :right_angle => :A, :base => 5, :height => 2.7
    square :base => :BA
    square :base => :CB
    square :base => :AC
    mark_right_angle :CAB

    render 'pythagoras.png'

  Only the 'triangle' and 'render' commands of that code work at the moment,
  but 'square' will be trivially implemented soon.  'mark_right_angle' may
  have to wait a while.

  Some examples that actually work can be seen in the 'html-demo' directory
  by opening 'index.html'.


STATUS

  I'm a high school teacher and can only work on this in my holidays.  At the
  moment (Nov 2009), RGeom can generate triangles (based on many sorts of
  specifications), circles (likewise) and segments.

  Over the Christmas holidays, several features (dots, labels, segment marks,
  angle marks) will hopefully be introduced and a proper release will
  hopefully occur.


FILES AND DIRECTORIES

  etc/
    Scripts for editing code, editing tests, and running tests.
    Aliases that are useful for this project.

  html-demo/
    Example code and descriptions used to create an HTML file
    with lots of pretty pictures and stuff.  Run
      ruby -Ilib html-demo/generate.rb
    to generate the file, and browse html-demo/index.html to
    see the result.

  lib/
    The RGeom library code.

  out/
    A directory into which unit tests can generate images.  These
    may be safely deleted at any time.

  test/
    Unit tests.


USAGE

    require 'rgeom'
    # RGeom code goes here, to define points, segments, triangles, etc.
    render 'filename.png'

  See the html-demo code for examples of RGeom code.


DEPENDENCIES

  All dependencies can be installed via Rubygems.

  In RGeom itself:
   * extensions
   * fattr
   * ruby-debug       [1]
   * dev-utils        [1]
   * term-ansicolor
   * facets

  [1] These are for debugging; if debugging code is removed, these
      dependencies are no longer required.
